Npm calls the reusable code a package.
A package is folder that contains a js code
Modules
Dependencies
There is no quality control in npm, so anyone can upload packages on npm

npm - global command, comes with node
npm --version

local dependency - use it only in this particular project
npm i <packageName>

global dependency - use it in any project
npm install -g <packageName> (deprecated)
sudo install -g <packageName> (mac) (deprecated)

package.json = manifest file (stores important info about project/package)
manual approach (create package.json in th root, create properties etc)
npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
npm init -y (everything default)

WHY PACKAGE.JSON IS IMPORTANT:
